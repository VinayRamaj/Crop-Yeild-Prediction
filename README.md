# Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts crop yield based on agricultural factors such as rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer usage using **Linear Regression**.  
A **Flask web application** is used to upload data and visualize actual vs predicted yield.


## Features
- Upload CSV dataset
- Automatic feature detection
- Machine Learning model (Linear Regression)
- Accuracy calculation
- State-wise yield prediction
- Graph visualization (Actual vs Predicted)


## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
